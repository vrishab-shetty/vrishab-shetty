### Auction Backend
Developed RESTful APIs using Java Spring Boot with an in-memory H2 database. This project involved containerizing services with Docker, setting up a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions for seamless deployments, and overseeing the entire software development lifecycle. A Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach was implemented with JUnit 4 and Mockito to maintain high code quality.

### Cloud Native API
Provisioned and managed cloud infrastructure on AWS/GCP using Terraform modules. A key feature was a Pub/Sub-based authentication microservice designed to enhance security. The architecture included auto-scaling groups and load balancers to ensure high availability, with the entire build, test, and deployment process automated through GitHub Actions.

### ReSSSipes
Engineered a backend using Node.js and MongoDB, focusing on query optimization for better performance. The front-end was built with React to support live, collaborative recipe editing. The application also integrated PassportJS for secure authentication and included an admin dashboard for effective content moderation.
